PRODIGY_ML_05

The task for the fifth project of Prodigy Infotech's Machine Learning Internship is to develop a model that can accurately identify a food and print its calories as well.

I have used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) dataset from Kaggle.

Attached is Jupyter notebook with code as well as documentation explaining in detail how to achieve the desired output.

I have also attached the outputs for this particular program.

I followed the following steps to obtain accurate outputs

Steps:

> Import necessary libraries such as open cv, mediapipe(for webcam) and pyautogui (for modifying the device volume)

> Import datasets

> Plot the items in each category. Make a list of categories and items in every category.

> Add convolution layers. 

> Make the training model and save it. 

> Using the training model, implement it on the testing set. 

> The model identifies the food accurately. 

> Assign every food category a set calorific quantity. 

> Output will contain both predicted food category and the calories it contains.
